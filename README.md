Clickable at the top right of the page did not scroll down to the informational section at the bottom of the screen.  Correced the <div> so that it included both the 'id' and the 'class'.

All three clickables at the top right functioned the same.  Made the class the same for each of them, enabling a clean up of the css style sheet.

Updated the copy path for the images so they could all come from one folder 

Cleaned up the spacing on index.html and included commentary for easier future use
